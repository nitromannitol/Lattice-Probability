The one-dimensional simple random walk kernel against the lazy one.

Two steps of the simple walk on `ℤ` make one step of the lazy walk on `2ℤ`:
the pair of increments `±1, ±1` sums to `0` with probability `1/2` and to `±2`
with probability `1/4` each.  So the simple kernel at an even time and an even
site is the lazy kernel of `LatticeProb/Walk/OneDim.lean`, and every bound
proved there transfers.  The consequence recorded here is the sup bound
`P^n(0, k) ≤ √2 / √(n+1)`, which has no parity restriction because at the times
and sites where the parity fails the kernel is zero.
